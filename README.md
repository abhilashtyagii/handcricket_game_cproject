# handcricket_game_cproject

Abstract of the project
	A simple yet an amazing game to play with your friends and family. Playing cricket is fun, but what if you don't have the equipment? What if you want to play a sweet little game in any given moment?
	The aim is to make the game playable on computer with the Computer vs Human mode. The game will start from a toss “ODD OR EVEN”. Now, the player will throw(input) a number. After this the computer will show its throw based on any random number. If the sum of these numbers is even then the player choosing even will be winner of the toss and same goes for the odd. The winning party will choose either to bat or to bowl. After this, the game will continue as per the choice filled. The batsman will now keep on inputting the runs against the balls delivered by the bowler. When both the players will throw a same number, it will be declared as an “OUT.” Now, the other player, yet to bat, will start his/her batting and will continue till he/she is out or surpasses the score given by first player. At the end, the winner will be declared and the game will be over.
Specialty: The program includes Artificial Intelligence enabled with the help of arrays which record the throw of last 6 balls(1 over) and tries to find a pattern in these throws. If the computer finds any specific pattern in these throws, it follows the series or pattern and throw its ball accordingly, similar to what a human being will do in real life.
